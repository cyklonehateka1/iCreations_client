          Many mental health apps either focus solely on tracking moods or
          providing meditation exercises, but they rarely combine these elements
          with a holistic approach to mental and physical health. Users need a
          central platform where they can manage their mental health, track key
          physical indicators, shop for relevant health products, and engage
          with a supportive community.
